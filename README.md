### WELCOME!

Iâ€™m JMRama :bowtie:. A few of my competencies are:
- Senior system administrator :computer:
- Database administrator :floppy_disk:
- And also :fish:<mark>a scuba diving instructor</mark>:whale: (which it's not very useful here, but, hey! it`s something i'm proud of :sunglasses:).

I'm quite new around here. I've never used this "tool" besides checking some code or see how some Python libraries or Powershell scripts work, but i'll come more often.

In my life i feel like i'm always learning ... and right now it's for real because I'm learning a lot about data science. I hope to become a valuable professional in the sector (:pray:).

You can reach me anytime you want in my email address.
